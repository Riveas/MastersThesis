# Masters thesis
Goal of my masters thesis is to implement algorithm that would allow user to control mobile platform using hand gestures. 
To achieve my goal i'll be basing on Mediapipe hand gestures model that detects 21 hand landmarks.
## Required modules:
* OpenCV
* Mediapipe
## Installation guide:
To ensure that your project will work fine first you'll need to install necessary modules. You can do it simply by running following commands in your terminal:  
pip install opencv-python  
pip install mediapipe  
## Setup
First thing to do is initiating opencv and mediapipe hand gestures model
